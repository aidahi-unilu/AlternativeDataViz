Experts had predicted that by the end of 2020 some 28 million people would have fall below the $1.90 extreme poverty line; now it appears at least will be 88 million people. If COVID-19 forces more extended lockdowns that figure could swell even higher, leaving more than 700 million people in the world’s lowest-income nations in extreme poverty. Even in middle-income nations nearly 450 million more people could be pushed below their poverty standard of $3.20 or $5.50 per day. The situation looks grim for 2021 as well. Poorer countries, with fewer safety nets to protect the vulnerable, will likely be slower to recover, and the long-term consequences of extreme poverty—from lack of education to malnutrition—will land heavily on children.",

To make it flexible enough, not to understand all the complexity of the world, but at least to measure it. And furthermore, to draw a few conclusions from it, the first of which would be our need for stories so that our mind can reproduce more than only itself and, through narration, can transform itself in a great workshop of possibilities, open to the future through the many ways it contributes to the construction of the past.",

        "description": "This study examines friendship and hostility relations between Roma students and the ethnically homogeneous non-Roma majority in Hungarian schools, where anti-Roma sentiments are strong. High-achieving Roma students have significantly more friends and fewer adversaries than low-achieving ones because of more non-Roma friends, fewer non-Roma adversaries, and the same number of Roma friends and adversaries.The associations are strong for publicly observable GPA but weak for unobserved test scores and may be the results of assignment to the same classes for many years. Simulations suggest that a mixed policy of desegregation and closing the achievement gap may best foster positive interethnic relations in this environment.",

        "description": "Many insect species spend early stages of their development inside host plants, where they feed and find shelter from predators and tough weather. Insect pests such as the Wheat stem sawfly invade wheat fields during the growing season, with negative impacts on grain yield. At Colorado State University, plant biology researchers study proteins which play a role in wheat defense to sawfly infestations. I participated in this research and you can read our findings here, and browse the following visuals for an overview. For context, the map below shows the recent southward expansion of sawfly populations across the United States (as of 2019).",

I looked up in the sky to find the bird, but all I could see was tree branches and forest. The bird kept on singing, but I had no idea where it was. I had no other choice than to mimic the sound of the bird and ask my dad the name of the bird. My dad used to tell me which bird it was. From very young, bird was the tree branches and big forest to me. This experience made me to visualize the sound of birds like forest.",

        "description": "How does impact change over a scientific career? Does impact, arguably the most relevant performance measure, follow predictable patterns? Can we predict the timing of a scientist’s outstanding achievement? Driven by these questions, we studied the evolution of productivity and impact throughout thousands of scientific careers. We reconstructed the publication record of scientists from seven disciplines, connecting each paper with its long-term impact on the scientific community as quantified by citation metrics. We found that the highest-impact work in a scientist’s career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. This result is known as the random impact rule. In this visualization, we show the random impact rule in all its power. You can explore careers in different disciplines, rank scientists according to different career parameters, or select a subset of them. You will always find the impact peaks occurring all over the place, from the beginning of a career on the left to the end of a career on the right.",

At that time, in the 1960s, youngsters were rebellious, the government was corrupted and the use of drugs were popular amongst people. In this song, Bob Dylan strongly emphasized the chaos of that era as a warning to people as well as an encouragement for people to renew themselves for the better. This poster focuses a lot on its lyrics so as to highlight all the things that were happening at that period of time, with a legend at the bottom to help better understand the data. The lyrics can also be seen behind the blocks of data.",

But many of the subjects that fascinated him, including death and sexuality, repeatedly surface in his art throughout the decades. Those recurring themes are grouped in a sampling of some 8,000 of Picasso's works, in the artist's style. They can be found in portraits that radically blur the line between subject and painter, and in an array of arresting symbols such as the Minotaur, bottle, and harlequin.",

We wanted to make the interactive part more special than a static visual. The final visual includes sound bites for some mergers. Hovering over a merger starts a tiny (physics based) animation of the merger. Clicking on any merger shows a pop-up modal with a lot more detailed information, such as a map of the sky that shows the rough location of where the gravitational waves originated from.",

This change affected the tone of media and of society as well. Our research focused on the anti-roma topics over this period. As the source of our analysis we used the kuruc.info online news portal that is the flagship of the far-right or \"national radical\" media in Hungary. The site covers ethnic minority issues on a regular basis. We analyzed the column \"Cigánybűnözés\" (\"Roma criminality\") that contains more than 10.000 anti-roma news from 2006 until today. We collected 10.304 news from 2006 until 2015 and extracted 27 anti-roma topics. Here you can discover the distribution of various topics over time along with the most important events that influenced each one of them. ",

I remembered checking out the newest games in the toy catalog to see whether there were any cool new games I wanted to put on my Christmas wish list. And one major factor I remember was always which games won the most recent ‚Spiel des Jahres‘ (‚Game of the Year‘) award. This German board game award is super famous here and a pretty big deal. I found a list of all past winners on Wikipedia as a starting point and added some additional information about the games (game type, number of players,…) by browsing their wiki pages.

AgBiome owns a large collection of gene sequences of different kinds of soil organisms, and tries to find species and specimens that are biologically active against crop pests. And they needed a way to show the size and structure of the collection, and how they are using their collection in a smart way. I have a background in bio-engineering, so I was a little familiar with all the Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas in the collection. I was also familiar with phylogenetics, so I knew the collection’s structure was a hierarchical tree of phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and ultimately species and individual specimens of each species. So my first reflex was to move in the direction of a tree of life, and make some dendrograms, showing the structure. I used R to construct the graph data from the tabular data that I received, and used the ggraph package to make some sketches.",

        "description": "The timeline uses buildings as the lens to visualize data, situating them in a network of complex interplay with architects, tools, technologies and design movements from the late 19th century to the present day, with continuous emphasis on parametric design. The visualization has been conceived for print, taking advantage of the large scale of the tabloid-sized report to unfold into an immersive, poster-sized design (measuring nearly five feet wide when completely open) that rewards close examination by readers. We collaborated closely with SPACE10 on the project. The visualization acts as a counterpart to the text of the 16-page report, which functions as both a broad overview and in-depth exploration of the subject. The text was written by the architecture historian and theorist Mollie Claypool and is intended for a mainstream audience, with clear, accessible language.",

Analyzing these games has helped me fondly remember a time when I looked forward to my weekly visit with my parents to have dinner and play a good game of Scrabble.

An examination of the facial expressions of the last six presidents during the past 10 inaugurations revealed remarkable differences in the moods and emotions they conveyed. Five of the past six presidents were either positive or measured during their speeches, a striking contrast to the negative countenance found in President Trump’s inaugural remarks. Shown here in the form of collected emotion arcs, each “feather” represents an inaugural address. Each barb of the feather is a moment during the speech where the president displayed an emotion — positive emotions are drawn above the quill, negative emotions below. The length of each barb represents the intensity of the emotion. The curve of the feather itself indicates the overall positivity or negativity of the speech.",

I wanted to simplify that data even more by using one image. To do this I made a wheel with 36 countries each getting an individual spoke, represented in a different colour. Each country has 11 bubbles representing the 11 different categories such as: jobs, environment, income, housing etc. The size of the bubble represents where that country ranks within that category. Therefore the bigger the bubble the higher they rank and the smaller the bubble the lower they rank.",

Antiquarian books are known for having lengthy titles, especially those of a scientific nature. These books’ frequently unassuming title pages are gateways to a wealth of knowledge and the focal point of this project. Title pages of antique influential scientific books covering a variety of subjects were coded and reimagined as colorful cityscapes based solely on their words to illustrate the unique body of knowledge readers would find within. This list is not exhaustive but a small sampling of influential books. More may be added and suggestions are welcomed. Boxes were drawn around each word of a title page and color-coded by its first letter (words beginning with “A” are one color, “B” another, and so on). Each title page has its own palette. Those boxes were then upended and arranged to form an abstract cityscape while maintaining their original sizes relative to each other.",

This simple question was directed toward Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s 1810 book, Theory of Colours. Goethe was German statesman and writer who wrote about his views on how colors are perceived by humans. While mostly rejected by the scientific community, it was embraced by and influenced philosophers and artists. Using the publicly available online version of the 1840 English translation from Project Gutenberg, every mention of color was highlighted and catalogued. Their usage ranged from the simplistic (“a large red image” and “again mixing with yellow”) to the more ornate (“such a hue equal in intensity to scarlet” and “golden rather than fiery”). These names were then grouped into nine common families of colors and assigned a color based on them: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, black, grey, and white.",

I created two very different pieces for this project.

The other was an animation that reveals how counties could show very similar values for the attitudinal dimensions, even though they are from completely different parts of the US, thereby transcending the typical geographic proximity that more traditional analysis tend to focus on",

The visualization is separated into two parts: weekly and monthly issues. A representative cover for each year of the weekly issues was chosen and each square displays the average color. The top five colors used in each monthly cover were extracted and arranged in bars organized by year and month. Hovering over any part of the visual shows the cover for that year or month.",

No two are the same—or even similar. Connections between the shape and the meaning of a sonnet is coincidental but a welcome interpretation. The signatures are not meant to assign meaning but to inspire others to think about them differently than before.",

These posters are meant to be printed at the same size as the original gold records, at 40x50cm. I therefore had a lot of room to add visual details from the elaborate datasets. I aimed for a type of work that should be placed on a wall and every time you walk by, you can read a bit more and learn something new for weeks and months. Something that’s worth it to print and frame, that keeps on giving insights the longer you look. Something that you can appreciate visually in an instant, but it takes longer to gain insights (should you even want to).",

The Top 2000 is an annual list of 2,000 songs, chosen by listeners, that airs on Dutch Radio NPO2 and is played between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. I actually played with this data before in 2014, when I was still very new to D3.js. Since artists sometimes revisit a past artwork to see how their style has evolved (which I always love to see), I thought it would be fitting to try and do the same myself. So, two years after my first attempt, I decided to look at the Top 2000 songs again and visualize which decade was the most popular in terms of the years the songs were released. Not to worry if you’re not Dutch; roughly 90% of the songs in the Top 2000 are sung in English (with Queen usually in first place) so the songs should seem familiar.",

We both decided early on that the data found within the album’s songs would be used to create the final artwork for the album. However, instead of directly using the songs’ computer files as the starting point for the visuals, the data was gathered from the songs by how they are meant to be experienced: through listening. With headphones, pencil and paper, I marked down the samples in the songs that particularly stood out to me, drew their journey up and down the musical scale, and counted the number of times these samples occurred in their songs. Using this information, I created a pencil ‘song mandala’ for each track. Therefore, all the artwork for the album is derived from my particular experience of listening and re-listening (and re-listening some more) to the songs on the album itself.",

The graphics represent complex relationships of movie references by combining macro views summarizing 100 years of movie influences with micro views providing a close-up look at the embedding of individual movies. The macro view shows the rise of the self-referential character of postmodern cinema, while the micro level illustrates differences between individual movies, when they were referenced and by whom. The visualizations provide views that are closer to the real complexity of the relationships than aggregated views or rankings could do.\n",

I found that I was more frequently anxious around the new moon and more frequently depressed around the full moon. Moods are nonlinear and neither is this timeline. I was drawn to a spiral configuration because it allows the viewer to compare the cycles, but also keeps a continuous timeline along the spiral. As I created the spiral I learned that though we refer to a first and third quarter moon, lunar time is not neatly broken into quadrants. I show how the moon shifts slightly per cycle.

I figured by the same token, positive events like marriage, securing a good career opportunity, big financial gain, enjoying a big vacation, achieving a milestone (e.g., graduation) can increase years of life. In this map of time, Year 1 of my life begins with a ring width reflecting \"typical conditions,\" meaning no significant negative or positive events occurred. The width of all other rings either increases (with significant positive events) or decreases (with significant negative events). The dashed white ring shows how long my life would have been if I had stayed at the status quo for 41 years. Not scientific by any means but this tells me that generally the positive events in my life have outweighed the bad ones, which is why my tree/life has grown beyond the white line.",

We wanted to portray an ecosystem, where each element supports and works in perfect synergy with the others to produce the finest outcomes. We felt that the lotus pond was an accurate symbolization of the nurturing environment at MathCo. where we constantly ensure that we communicate and collaborate to build winning solutions.

This became the base data set, around which we set out to quantify, then visualize, the literary productivity of each author, also adding the main awards they won and the length of each writer’s life, to provide additional context.

Combining several different data sources depicting the world from both global and local-individual perspectives, the installation tells stories of people and their relationship with what has been around them over time, layering dense and granular information within the narration to highlight how change is pervasive at all scales.",

After learning that Escher is famous for Optical art and tessellation, I’m curious about when did he start exploring Optical art? What other art styles did he use in his career? So I collected the data for all of his works to see if there are answers. Data of each piece of work include the year of publish, art style, and whether the work is 'famous' according to the data source website. Inspired by Escher’s tessellation art, I chose a V-shape tile to represent each piece of work and tessellated 455 tiles to form a timeline. This timeline shows that Escher started exploring Optical art as early as in his 20s but didn't focus on it until his 40s. His works before 40 were mostly Expressionism style or Surrealism style. In the three decades afterward, Escher focused on Optical art and all of his most famous works were published in that period.\n",

I prefer to walk for exercise, as time permits, outside in addition to whatever other walking I do as I go about my day. My goal is to walk as much as I can every day. I use the Pedometer app on my iPhone to document my steps, miles, and flights of stairs climbed. I use a system of symbols to represent each thousand steps. Instead of showing exactly how many I walk. The black icons represent up to 9999 steps walked each day, red represents 10,000-19,999 steps and yellow represents 20,000-29,999 steps. ",

And I always knew which writer I would choose because I am a big fan of his writing-style and his stories: John Irving. His books are full of colourful characters (often gays and/or trans are included) and the stories take you down a swirling path of events, which can feel as a rollercoaster of emotions. Disturbing, heart-breaking, unavoidably sad and luckily sometimes glorious moments. The book I chose, Hotel New Hampshire (from 1981) is the first one of John Irving I read, after that, many followed. I remember the movie adaption vaguely but I do know it starred Rob Lowe, Jodie Foster and Nastasja Kinski. So here you find my dataviz/dataart project on the Hotel New Hampshire. The characters from the book were the starting point for my visualizations: I counted the number of actions they carried out and the words they spoke.",

I have tons of hobbies: I’m a heavy reader, I like riding my bike, cooking, listening to podcasts, but I probably spend the most time watching series (660 episodes of 62 different ones). Last year this added up to 645 hours of content, that is 27 whole days. By looking at this number, I was half proud – half ashamed, but let me tell you, it was a damn fine year! Sorry in advance for the not too subtle Twin Peaks remarks, but I had 3 resolutions for 2021. Reading the Dune, baking a babka, and watching the Twin Peaks saga in which I’m elbowed deep in. Prepare to be disappointed: I haven’t scraped the data but logged everything I watched each day to a spreadsheet. At the end of the year, I double-checked the Rotten Tomato and IMDB scores if they changed. I was anxious all the time that I might have forgotten to make a note of something that would ruin my whole project, but I managed to follow through. This was one of my hardest ideas to execute, and I’m 100% sure I wouldn’t do it again. If I’d get paid for the hours I spent building the dataset, drinks would be on me. I still have PTSD when I’m watching something and realizing this should have been logged.",

All data visualizations below have been hand drawn and digitalized in a later context. This project has been a great experiment diving into the world of data visualization, finding inspiration and patterns in my surroundings and understanding the value of human data. I personally found a great inspiration in the beauty and richness of nature. The data visualization below uses dried flower patels as the main material.

In the Pacific theater, Japanese forces dominated—until the U.S. claimed victory at the Battle of Midway and began wresting back island after island in bloody battles across the ocean.

Here we distill these impacts and trends. We combined several data sets to quantify the different types of genetic element that have been discovered and that generated publications, and how the pattern of discovery and publishing has changed over the years. Our analysis linked together data including RNA transcripts; around 1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); human diseases with documented genetic roots; approved and experimental pharmaceuticals; and scientific publications between 1900 and 2017. Our editorial team at Nature worked together with the network research team from Barabasi Lab to create the visualisation. The final product is the narrated video but the visualisation was also used on the magazine cover and featured as an infographic inside the magazine and online.",

Something definitely recognizable in the personalities of the founders of CLEVER°FRANKE.

We did this by showing the angle of the pie pieces in relation to the other weather elements and the deviation in comparison to the absolute average of 2010.

Four panels further focus on specific aspects: the level of experience of members is represented as a temperature map, their education is represented as territories, changes observed with respect to the 2020 survey are presented as migration flows; finally, a heatmap illustrates the most common tools and charts.",

Based in research that small daily stress adds up to long-term chronic health issues. Daily stressors, such as an argument with a spouse or an impending deadline, are associated with short-term changes in physical health symptoms. And this study in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine showed the increased risk of reporting a chronic physical health condition in the future.",

I was asked to create a piece to be placed in the Royal Festival Hall that would make the benefits of open data approachable and accessible to passerby (both children and adults) who might not have much experience with data. When creating this project, it made sense to use the concept of play to communicate open data: open datasets are published online and anyone can play with them, use them, and interact with them. I created an ‘Open Data Playground’ where open datasets that describe key benefits of open data would be used to create floor-based games similar to those found in school playgrounds, giving people the opportunity to physically ‘play’ with an open dataset and interpret and make sense of the ‘data’ as they see fit.

The backward embroidered sheet seemed to me like a metaphor for that database and helped me to realize our role in dataviz: we order. In my case, the front of the sheet had all the stitches organized neatly in line with the message of the data.

        "description": "Poemage is a tool for exploring and analysing the sound topology of a poem. It is an interdisciplinary work between poetry scholars, computer scientists and linguists. Recommended reading is not only the presented paper Show ambiguity, which takes a more poetry scholar influenced perspective on Poemage but also the companion paper which complements “Show ambiguity” by adding the computer scientist stance to it. Besides the methodological principles that are covered by Poemage both papers give also great insight into the collaborative aspects of the project across disciplines.",

In nation A, the top bar contains a changing gradient, indicating that “man” is a continuum from male enfant to adult, or in countries E and D, that gender ambiguity is a factor of genetic mutation or adaptation, thus showing that basis on which gendered individuals are identified and counted is complicated by many factors. In country F women only register as individuals after coming of reproductive age, thus showing that quantity is a effect of cultural conditions, not a self-evident fact. The movement of men back and forth across the border of nations B and C makes the “nations” unstable entities. Graphic credit Xárene Eskandar.",

The box “day” does not have an a priori dimension that is used to contain the elements, it is created as an effect of the elements. This is a distinctly different approach to metrics. The chart is generated to express the co-dependent relation of viewer and experience rather than to display user experience as if it were independent of observation. The temporal dimensional of each day depends upon the relations among events, moods, and activities, but not predictably. The shape of the days is made by the creation of the list.

While new techniques are proliferating they still fall short of offering whole language experimentation. We provide a mathematical technique that maps words and symbols to ordered unique numerical values, showing that this mapping is one-to-one and onto. We demonstrate this technique through linear, planar, and volumetric visualizations of data sets as large as the Oxford English Dictionary and as small as a single poem. The visualizations of this space have been designed to engage the viewer in the analogic practice of comparison already in use by literary critics but on a scale inaccessible by other means. We studied our visualization with expert participants from many fields including English studies, Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer Graphics. We present our findings from this study and discuss both the criticisms and validations of our approach.",

        "description": "For this collection I combined elements of generative art and data art. Each piece uses the same underlying flow algorithm, but I’ve fine-tuned each to look like the element I’m trying to convey. I went with the elements of Earth, Water, Air, Sun. Yes, Sun instead of Fire because (perhaps as an Astronomer) I think sunlight is a far more necessary element than fire. Finally, as an “extra” element I added Digital, since many people wouldn’t/couldn’t live without this being part of their lives. For all pieces, except Digital, I’ve added data relevant to the element as “obstacles” in the flows. Tree density for Earth, rainfall for Water, air quality for Air, and sunshine hours for Sun. Each of the pieces has been sold as an NFT on Foundation.",

        "description": "In celebration of 100 years of bird banding, Scientific American (Jen Christiansen) commissioned me to create a visualization for the March 2021 edition. The Bird Banding Laboratory has been curating bird banding records since 1920. In 1959 a fire damaged many of the records, which helped to drive a shift toward electronic record keeping. For practical reasons, most research projects today deal with the digitized records, starting with birds first banded or reencountered after 1960. This visualization shows the birds that lie at the heart of the digitized data: 70,593,588 banding records and 4,134,060 reencounter records from 1960 through 2016. Two visualizations have been created, the first one shows the number of birds banded over time for the various categories of birds (with beautiful illustrations by Liz Wahid) of the most common bird in each category. A second visualization shows 4 globes, one for each seasons, indicating where and how many birds were banded, including a special note of the a bird that has the longest travel.",

It's sorted to reduce the number of arc overlaps. The resulting artistic network and styling are a nod to a bird feather. It's clear that one bird in particular really liked to dine with company!",

Imagine how DeAndre Jordan, professional basketball player for over a decade, feels every time he steps onto the free throw line. Over his entire career, he has made, and I actually had to fact check this, fewer than 50% of his free throws. Every time he goes to the line, he’s throwing up literal and figurative moonshots. Just imagine if Christoph Scheiner had been around as a basketball fan in the 21st century. Instead of mapping the progressions of celestial bodies and sunspots, he may have instead mapped DeAndre Jordan free throws.",

        "description": "“5Years” Project by Camilla De Amicis, the project is a data visualisation summarising five years of a love story.\nThe idea starts from an awareness of the traces that are left spatially by living experiences together on a daily basis. The relationship between the two, being at a distance, has led the couple to experience different cities and places, some more frequently than others. Each coloured macro shape represents a city, the name of which is deliberately left unstated so that only the couple can trace the specific locations. Instead, the dark dots on the spots trace the position of the exact locations on the city map locally. Each experience was distinguished on the basis of type (whether or not related to a culinary event) and the type of memory associated with the experience. In this case, data collection is based on the experience and mental reconstruction and through traces (photographs, items saved on online maps, notes) of one of the two members of the pair. The approach to data visualisation in this case becomes personal and deliberately subjective, in order to create an emotional narrative through data that blends a humanistic vision with a more technical and spatially faithful one.",
