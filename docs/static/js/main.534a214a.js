If COVID-19 forces more extended lockdowns that figure could swell even higher, leaving more than 700 million people in the world\u2019s lowest-income nations in extreme poverty. Even in middle-income nations nearly 450 million more people could be pushed below their poverty standard of $3.20 or $5.50 per day. The situation looks grim for 2021 as well.

High-achieving Roma students have significantly more friends and fewer adversaries than low-achieving ones because of more non-Roma friends, fewer non-Roma adversaries, and the same number of Roma friends and adversaries.The associations are strong for publicly observable GPA but weak for unobserved test scores and may be the results of assignment to the same classes for many years.

I participated in this research and you can read our findings here, and browse the following visuals for an overview.

Does impact, arguably the most relevant performance measure, follow predictable patterns? Can we predict the timing of a scientist\u2019s outstanding achievement? Driven by these questions, we studied the evolution of productivity and impact throughout thousands of scientific careers. We reconstructed the publication record of scientists from seven disciplines, connecting each paper with its long-term impact on the scientific community as quantified by citation metrics. We found that the highest-impact work in a scientist\u2019s career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. This result is known as the random impact rule. In this visualization, we show the random impact rule in all its power. You can explore careers in different disciplines, rank scientists according to different career parameters, or select a subset of them. You will always find the impact peaks occurring all over the place, from the beginning of a career on the left to the end of a career on the right.","category":["Rhetoric and Embellishment","Statistical Graphs Variations","Granularity"]},{"id":"99","name":"Subterranean Homesick Blues","image":"images/HomesickBlues.jpg","author":"Nidia Marissa","url":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/37832197/Bob-Dylan-Data-Visualization","description":"In respect to Bob Dylan, this data visualization poster is based on one of his most popular songs.

I never asked myself that question, before agro-biotech company AgBiome asked me. AgBiome owns a large collection of gene sequences of different kinds of soil organisms, and tries to find species and specimens that are biologically active against crop pests. And they needed a way to show the size and structure of the collection, and how they are using their collection in a smart way. I have a background in bio-engineering, so I was a little familiar with all the Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas in the collection. I was also familiar with phylogenetics, so I knew the collection\u2019s structure was a hierarchical tree of phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and ultimately species and individual specimens of each species. So my first reflex was to move in the direction of a tree of life, and make some dendrograms, showing the structure. I used R to construct the graph data from the tabular data that I received, and used the ggraph package to make some sketches.","category":["Custom Encoding","Rhetoric and Embellishment","Statistical Graphs Variations","Granularity"]},{"id":"135","name":"How Long are the Nights?","image":"images/LongNights.png","author":"Krisztina Sz\xfccs","url":"https://plotparade.com/gallery_sunrise.html","description":"This data visualization created by Krisztina Szucs shows the sunrise and sunset times around the world.

One being a large static poster that looks at each dimension per US state to see which states show interesting behaviors (e.g. different from most other states). The other was an animation that reveals how counties could show very similar values for the attitudinal dimensions, even though they are from completely different parts of the US, thereby transcending the typical geographic proximity that more traditional analysis tend to focus on","category":["Rhetoric and Embellishment","Statistical Graphs Variations"]},{"id":"182","name":"175 Years of Scientifc American Covers","image":"images/ScientificAmericanCovers.jpg","author":"Nicholas Rougeux","url":"https://www.c82.net/work/?id=379","description":"In celebration of its 175th anniversary, Scientific American wanted to explore visualizing the color trends of its 5,148 covers since the beginning.

The visualization is separated into two parts: weekly and monthly issues. A representative cover for each year of the weekly issues was chosen and each square displays the average color. The top five colors used in each monthly cover were extracted and arranged in bars organized by year and month. Hovering over any part of the visual shows the cover for that year or month.","category":["Statistical Graphs Variations","Granularity"]},{"id":"183","name":"Sonnet Signature","image":"images/SonetSignature.jpg","author":"Nicholas Rougeux","url":"https://www.c82.net/work/?id=348","description":"Sonnet Signatures visualizes each of Shakespeare\'s 154 sonnets by charting the letters used within each one. This requires some extra thought when looking at the sonnets but it\'s of secondary importance. What\'s more interesting to consider is the hidden shapes revealed by looking at centuries-old poetry through a different lens. This lens gives each sonnet its own identity like a person\'s signature. No two are the same\u2014or even similar. Connections between the shape and the meaning of a sonnet is coincidental but a welcome interpretation. The signatures are not meant to assign meaning but to inspire others to think about them differently than before.","category":["Custom Encoding","Rhetoric and Embellishment","Multivariate Glyphs","Granularity"]},{"id":"184","name":"Re-imagining music\'s Gold Record with Data Art","image":"images/MusicDataArt.png","author":"Nadieh Bremer","url":"https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/sony-music-data-art/","description":"Sony Music reached out to collaborate on creating a data-driven re-imagination of the \u2018gold record\u2019, the record certifications plaques that celebrate milestones in the journey of a song or album.

Not to worry if you\u2019re not Dutch; roughly 90% of the songs in the Top 2000 are sung in English (with Queen usually in first place) so the songs should seem familiar.","category":["Rhetoric and Embellishment","Multivariate Glyphs","Statistical Graphs Variations","Granularity"]},{"id":"206","name":"Data Murmurations: Points in flight (People Like You)","image":"images/DataMurmurations.jpg","author":"Stefanie Posavec","url":"https://www.stefanieposavec.com/data-murmurations","description":"For the majority of my career, my projects centred around the visualisation of a specific dataset, where the work\u2019s aesthetic and message are created through faithfully translating every data point into graphic elements and visual form.

I figured by the same token, positive events like marriage, securing a good career opportunity, big financial gain, enjoying a big vacation, achieving a milestone (e.g., graduation) can increase years of life. In this map of time, Year 1 of my life begins with a ring width reflecting \\"typical conditions,\\" meaning no significant negative or positive events occurred. The width of all other rings either increases (with significant positive events) or decreases (with significant negative events). The dashed white ring shows how long my life would have been if I had stayed at the status quo for 41 years. Not scientific by any means but this tells me that generally the positive events in my life have outweighed the bad ones, which is why my tree/life has grown beyond the white line.","category":["Custom Encoding","Rhetoric and Embellishment","Granularity"]},{"id":"229","name":"Eine Grafische Grammatik f\xfcr Deutsch als Fremdsprache","image":"images/GrafischeDeutsch.png","author":"Barbara Avila Vissirini","url":"https://www.dieseskleinebuch.de/en/","description":"Based on an analysis of the available visual variables and the most important grammatical features of the German language for non native speakers, Barbara developed a visual support system for grammar instruction.

At the end of the year, I double-checked the Rotten Tomato and IMDB scores if they changed. I was anxious all the time that I might have forgotten to make a note of something that would ruin my whole project, but I managed to follow through. This was one of my hardest ideas to execute, and I\u2019m 100% sure I wouldn\u2019t do it again. If I\u2019d get paid for the hours I spent building the dataset, drinks would be on me.

Our analysis linked together data including RNA transcripts; around 1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); human diseases with documented genetic roots; approved and experimental pharmaceuticals; and scientific publications between 1900 and 2017.

We demonstrate this technique through linear, planar, and volumetric visualizations of data sets as large as the Oxford English Dictionary and as small as a single poem. The visualizations of this space have been designed to engage the viewer in the analogic practice of comparison already in use by literary critics but on a scale inaccessible by other means.

For practical reasons, most research projects today deal with the digitized records, starting with birds first banded or reencountered after 1960. This visualization shows the birds that lie at the heart of the digitized data: 70,593,588 banding records and 4,134,060 reencounter records from 1960 through 2016. Two visualizations have been created, the first one shows the number of birds banded over time for the various categories of birds (with beautiful illustrations by Liz Wahid) of the most common bird in each category.

Each coloured macro shape represents a city, the name of which is deliberately left unstated so that only the couple can trace the specific locations. Instead, the dark dots on the spots trace the position of the exact locations on the city map locally. Each experience was distinguished on the basis of type (whether or not related to a culinary event) and the type of memory associated with the experience. In this case, data collection is based on the experience and mental reconstruction and through traces (photographs, items saved on online maps, notes) of one of the two members of the pair.
